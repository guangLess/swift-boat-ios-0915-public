/*
an immutable string named name,
a mutable array of type String named sailors,
a mutable Double named maxSpeedKnots, and
a mutable Double named speedKnots assigned to zero.
Write a designated initializer that covers the name, sailors, and maxSpeedKnots properties. It should not interact with speedKnots which already has a value of zero.

init(name:String, age:UInt) {
self.name = name
self.age = age
}

convenience init(name:String) {
self.init(name: name, age: 0)
//        self.name = name
}

Write a convenience initializer that accepts arguments for name and maxSpeedKnots. It should call the designated initializer, passing its two arguments along, and submitting an empty array of type String to the sailors argument.
Hint: [String]() creates an empty array of type String.

convenience init(name:String) {
self.init(name: name, age: 0)
//        self.name = name
}
